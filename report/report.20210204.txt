\section{Introduction}
%1) Problem statement:
Recently /*in China=> */, there are a lot of controversies about /* the copyright of /*-a*/ pictures*/ => image copyright. [citation from paper, ]
This problem has been troubled a lot of photographers, firms and companies.
In China, there was an incident about a company called ChinaVisual.
On Apr. 11th, 2019, a picture of Blackhole is posted on the Chinavisual.com,
% But the problem is 
while the copyright of this picture belongs to an organization called Event Horizon Telescope. [citation]
Also, people found many images like the national flags and so on.
Many people ask ChinaVisual: "Are those pictures belongs to your organization?" [citation] 
This kind of incidents don't just happen in China, things like stealing images and using illegally happens all over the world.

%The objective of me is to improve the environment like this. Is there a better method of protecting these images from there owner?
The motivation of this project is to conduct a survey regarding to solving the issue of protection of image copyright.

This paper is going to discover this issue into two sub-topic: image clustering and watermarking. % survey paper
Others' works.

        %I separate my discovery into two different parts including: 

How can we know when our image is stole by other people.
% ref. Frequency_Domain_Watermarking_An_Overview.pdf

a) Reverse image search:
%There are already a lot of mature searching engine has a function called reverse image search.
The definition of reverse image search.  {rephrasing https://www.duplichecker.com/reverse-image-search.php    }

%Examples like:
Many companies and individuals release reverse image search engines, such as Tineye, google, noobox and so on.

The reverse image searching work when you have an image.
For example, if you have an image of cat, you can put it into the reverse image searching, and it will provide you thousands of similar images whatever posted online.

% These searching engines are basic using a method called RGB.
Most of the principle of searching engines are color-based.

The method is simply find the red, green, blue value for each images and do comparison. % to be specific, rephrase, {resource from website, wiki}
%If the similarity is bigger than 90%. Two pictures deem to be the same.

b) image clustering
1. color-based pixel, 1920*1080, computation is huge

2. visual information retrieval
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval
item classification.

3. todo survey, if this algo exists [cite this]
if not exist, write into Proposed Method.

thought:
1. target image: opencv get its sketch_t 素描画.  feature engineering.

hough line transformation

benefits:
applications:
computation, storage (feature vectors, [90,90,40,40,0], [90,90,10,10,10];
        machine learning model ).

2. get set_of_sketches of images from tineye
3. search if sketch_t is in set_of_sketches, set()

{
'ladder': [ index of images];
'railroad': [ index of images];
'road': [ index of images];
}

This paper is going to discover this issue into two sub-topic: image cluster and water mark.
