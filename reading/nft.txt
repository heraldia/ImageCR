non-fungible Token
A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data on a digital ledger called a blockchain, where each NFT can represent a unique digital item, and thus they are not interchangeable. NFTs can represent digital files such as art, audio, videos, items in video games and other forms of creative work.

NFT全称为non-fungible Token，中文名叫非同质化通证。

NFT's as a service is a rising industry in 2020. One of the most famous service providers is 0xcert, an easy to use token gateway API  built on top of Ethereum. It offers services catering to all forms of industries and use cases, including art, rare items, supply chain, certificates & licenses, education credentials, and in-game collectibles. It combines the physical and digital worlds of blockchains by using secure tags attached to the physical item in the real world and this tag contains the keys required to access the asset on the blockchain, thus making it a highly effective way to prove and transfer ownership. Also, the API's provide a way for artists to make a percentage in royalty every time one of their assets is sold. This can be automated easily using smart contracts and provides a safe and effective way for them to receive money from their paintings and artwork .
